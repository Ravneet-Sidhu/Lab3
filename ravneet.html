It was constructed between 1638 and 1648 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for around 200 years. The fort is made of red sandstone, which gives it its name, and features grand structures like the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audiences) and the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences). The fort's architecture is a blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles.</p>
